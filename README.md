# sketchr

A native SwiftUI implementation of an infinite sketching canvas, similar to Excalidraw.

Sketchr offers two quick shortcuts to:
- Annotate on top of your screen with a transparent overlay, useful for demos.
- Open an 'always on top', resizable infinite drawing canvas, useful for quick sketches and mockups.
